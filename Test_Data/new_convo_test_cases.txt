It is a fine day today , right ? __eou__ Yes , it is. It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? __eou__ I'd very much like to . __eou__ All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . __eou__ Who's playing ? __eou__ It's the Powell orchestra . __eou__ Do you know what they are playing ? __eou__ They're doing a seventeenth-century program . __eou__ And who is directing ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? __eou__ Well , do you think I have to ? __eou__ I do. We haven't watered them for quite a few days . __eou__ Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different . Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to . Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about going to English corner with me ? __eou__ Oh , I'd rather not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . __eou__ That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I passed ! __eou__ Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . __eou__ Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . __eou__ Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . __eou__ You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You . __eou__
I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor . __eou__ That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon . __eou__ I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks . __eou__ No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . __eou__ I will . It's most thoughtful of you . __eou__
I think your speech was excellent . __eou__ Was it ? __eou__ Sure it was . __eou__ Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . __eou__ But you did it and did it well ! __eou__
We can't wait any longer ... __eou__ I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... __eou__ You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? __eou__ I can't afford to . __eou__ All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . __eou__ Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . __eou__
Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? __eou__ I don ’ t really mind . __eou__ We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . __eou__ I suppose I could . __eou__ Come on , let ’ s try it . __eou__ All right . If you really want to . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t care less . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__ By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . __eou__ Good , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? __eou__ Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . __eou__ What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? __eou__ Helen is nice but she talks a lot . __eou__ Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? __eou__ nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I can't remember . __eou__ Are you sure you can't remember ? __eou__ I've absolutely certain . __eou__ Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? __eou__ I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . __eou__ Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Quite sure . __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__ I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . __eou__
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__
I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . __eou__ Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__ All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! __eou__ Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . __eou__ But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . __eou__
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ You can count on it . __eou__ I think so.Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him.He ' s good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__
David , I ’ m going to China . __eou__ Really ? How do you get the chance ? __eou__ You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . __eou__ Congratulations . How lucky you are ! __eou__ Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . __eou__ I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . __eou__ I ’ m sure I will . __eou__ Have a nice journey , Lily . __eou__ Thank you , David . __eou__
Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? __eou__ No , it ’ s my sister . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ She ’ s 18 . __eou__ She is tall ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? __eou__ Well , just a little thin . __eou__
Is this your new teacher ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Is she short ? __eou__ No , she ’ s average . __eou__ What color are her eyes ? __eou__ They ’ re dark gray . __eou__ What color is her hair ? __eou__ It ’ s blond . __eou__ And how old is she ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian . __eou__
Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . __eou__ I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million . __eou__ What if I said no ? __eou__ Ever hear of WebTracker ? __eou__ You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . __eou__ I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . __eou__ OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . __eou__
This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . __eou__ No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! __eou__ Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . __eou__ No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! __eou__ It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . __eou__
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__
Have you got your invitation yet ? __eou__ My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? __eou__ The house warming party . __eou__ Whose house warming party is it ? __eou__ Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . __eou__ Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . __eou__ It's out in the suburbs . __eou__ Have you seen the house ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . __eou__ Is it nice ? __eou__ Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . __eou__ Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? __eou__ They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . __eou__ When are they going to have the party ? __eou__ Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . __eou__ Wow , that would be something to look forward to . __eou__
Can you speak Japanese ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school . And I'm still learning it now . __eou__ How long have you been learning it ? __eou__ About three years . __eou__ Can you speak any other languages ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? __eou__ No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . __eou__ How much was the ticket ? __eou__ I only paid two dollars for mine . __eou__
Frank is getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
When ’ re you getting married ? __eou__ We planned our wedding for next May . __eou__ Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? __eou__ Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . __eou__ That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? __eou__ Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . __eou__ Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . __eou__
You look great ! __eou__ Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . __eou__ So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . __eou__ I surely am . But still there is one single problem . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . __eou__ It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? __eou__ I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? __eou__ More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? __eou__ Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ I can do that . __eou__ Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . __eou__ How did it go ? __eou__ Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . __eou__
Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch . __eou__ May , I really regret watching it with you last night . __eou__ Did it scare you ? __eou__ Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring . __eou__ Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . __eou__ Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary . __eou__ I like scary movies . __eou__ That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! __eou__ Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you . __eou__ Don't call me kid . I am a grownup . __eou__ Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? __eou__ Of course ! I can watch them without you ! __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . __eou__ I've said you will enjoy your life here ! __eou__ I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . __eou__ My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__ Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . __eou__ He performs very well . He is so funny ! __eou__ OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! __eou__ OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . __eou__ OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! __eou__
Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . __eou__ Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Please come in . __eou__ Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . __eou__ I really appreciate it . __eou__ Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . __eou__ I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . __eou__ Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . __eou__ Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that's nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . __eou__
A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . __eou__ That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . __eou__ He must be regretting about having done the business . __eou__ I bet he is . He domed his own life . __eou__
Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__ Please think it over . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . __eou__ It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . __eou__ Ur , you really let me down . __eou__ Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . __eou__ No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . __eou__ What day is it on earth ? __eou__ It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers .
