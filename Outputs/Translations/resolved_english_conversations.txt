Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized . Don ’ t you feel energized ?  I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this .  What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !  Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick .  Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain .  I am wiped out . Thank you .  Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you gonna come back again with me ?  Never ! But thank you for inviting me .  Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 

Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?  No , we don't have a reservation .  How many of you , please ?  Six , including two kids .  I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . 

Could I have my bill , please ?  Certainly , sir .  I'm afraid there's been a mistake .  I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?  I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here .  I'll just go and check it for you , sir . 

Are you through with your meal ?  Yes , we are through with our meal . Could we have the check please ?  Here you go . I can take care of it here when you are all ready .  Do you accept checks ?  No , I'm sorry we don't accept checks . We accept credit cards and cash .  Well , I don't have any cash with me , I'll have to put it on a credit .  Thank you , I'll be right back . Do you need any to go boxes ? I'd be glad to bring you some when I come back .  Yes , we do need to-go boxes , thank you . 

I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ?  Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ?  Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best .  In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made .  Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ?  Yes , we do have it in size 6 , we also have this same style in dark blue and red .  No , thank you . I'm just looking for a black pair .  Let me go to the back and get them . I'll be right back . 

Are you OK ?  I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .  So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?  I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending .  What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep .  Did you fall asleep ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before .  I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive .  Then I doubt if you like operas at all .  Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .  OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .  Very impressive . And I do love the leading actress who has an amazing voice .  Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .  Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .  And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing !  No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .  Exactly . 

I'm sorry . Is that bicycle yours ?  Yes , it is mine . What about it ?  I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot .  I see .  I'm really sorry . I'll face the music .  Where did you hit it ?  Right here . See the scratch ?  Oh , Yes , I see it now . 

Hi , sorry to have kept you waiting .  That's all right .  How are you ?  Fine , and you ? 

Would you ring these up for me here ?  I would be happy to ring these up for you . Did you find everything you needed ?  Yes , I did find everything I needed , thanks .  The total is 200 dollars . Would you like to put that on Sears card ?  No , I'll pay for it in cash . 

I can't finish this steak .  That's all right, you don't have to finish this steak . 

Let's go !  Where to go ? 

You stepped on my foot !  Sorry . I didn't mean to step on your foot . 

Where are you going ?  To the office . I'll be right back . 

Could you babysit for me tonight ?  I'd be glad to babysit for you tonight . 

Do you play mahjong ?  Once in a while . 

Get up , you lazybones !  Just a minute . 

Shall we start decorating the bedroom ?  I've already started .  When ?  This afternoon . 

You just ran a red light .  Did I run a red light ? 

First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes .  I take it you've done this before ?  Yes , for the last 20 years .  Good . 

I stayed at Bob's last night .  I was worried where you were .  I guess I should have told you .  Yes , you should have told you . 

Anna , Would you like to dance ?  I ’ d love to dance , but I ’ m a terrible dancer . I ’ m afraid I may step on your toes .  Don ’ t worry about it . I ’ ll show you how . It ’ s a piece of cake .  Thank you . I ’ ll try my best . 

Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ?  I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .  When do you expect him back ?  I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .  Well , may I leave a message ?  Yes , of course .  Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?  Ok . Does he know your number ?  I'm afraid he doesn't know my number . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .  13924774026 .

Do you have a bus schedule ?  Yes , I do have the bus schedule . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand .  I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ?  Yes , it is the right bus for the Museum .  Do I have to change ?  No, you don't have to change . The Museum is the terminal of this bus .  Thanks a lot .  You are welcome . 

Jenny , what's your favorite color ?  I like red .  Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ?  Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I draw with crayons ?  Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . 

Mom , my nose is bleeding .  What happened , Peter ? Did you have a fight ?  No , mom . I didn't have a fight .  Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ?  Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . 

It's your turn now , Helen .  OK . I'm coming .  This is your song . I picked it for you .  Thank you . You are so considerate .  Push the red button on the mike to turn it on .  OK . This key is too high for me .  I think it's a piece of cake for you .  OK . Let me have a try ...  Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you can sing one day .  Thank you .

Kate , can we change the channel ?  Why ?  This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .  OK . You can change it .  What about this one ?

We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days .  Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they filming a movie up there ?  Some high speed chase scene , I think .  I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that .  I think that they get a pretty good payoff .  The movie company has to pay them ?  I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity !  Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! 

Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ?  I did eat the cookies , Mom .  Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 

What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ?  I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?  They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate, don't you think ?  Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .  How about drinking soda ?  Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever .  And have you ever tried taking vitamins ?  I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take vitamins anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .  How do you know so much about food and dieting ?  You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! 

Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline .  I wish I could have some icecream , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight .  Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite .  I'd better not have just a bite . Please don't tempt me . Please !  Gee ! You are really strong-willed .  You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong .  Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . 

You have a lovely house , Jack .  Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .  That's too bad . What problems are you having .  Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .  I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?  Sure, you can make some suggestions .  Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room  Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .  You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 

Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ?  Yes , several times .  How do you like them ?  Not bad .  I always have the temptation to eat something there .  Then , why didn't you eat something there ?  I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?  Some of them , I think , are not good .  It doesn't taste good ?  No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .  That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?  I judge by appearances .  I got it . I think it's worth trying .  It certainly is worth trying .  I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .  Don't try everything at one time , please .  I see . Thank you . 

Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?  I don't want to .  Well , come over and talk to me then .  I certainly, will not come over and talk to you .  May I turn on the TV then ?  Turn on the TV , for what ?  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .  Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you cook dinner ?  I will cook dinner , but let's go to the disco after dinner .  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 

Where is your dressing room ?  Right over there .  ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ?  I loved it . I'll take it .  Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 .  Here you go ?  Do you have a credit card with us ?  No I don't have a credit card with you .  If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today .  Not today . Thanks though .  No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to open up a card , just let us know .  Sure .  Is there anything else I can help you with ?  Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ?  Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day .  Great . Thanks for your help .  Thank you , and have a great day . 

The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us .  Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ?  Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant !  So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ...  Wait , you love salmon , don't you love salmon ? They have the best salmon pasta .  That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ?  Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !  I see what you mean ! 

Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ?  Everything about them was different , even the theaters .  I'm really interested . Tell me about them .  Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family .  That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food .  We did bring our own food . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .  Why don't we do that anymore ?  Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . 

Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?  Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .  Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?  Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .  I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .  Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .  Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .  Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't see . 

( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ?  No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !  I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .  Do you know a lot about cars ?  A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to take a look .  Please . Thank you so much for stopping .  Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .  That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .  Did you have an accident recently . Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !  You do know this car ?  I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .  I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .  Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?  What kind of deal ?  I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .  You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?  I'd rather not want my insurance company to pay for it . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .  If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?  Hell , I don't care . Just don't submit a report to your insurance company .  It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! 

Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?  I did give your dog this cooked chicken bone . Why ?  Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?  No , I didn't know . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . 

Would you like to see our new shirts ?  Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things .  Well , they are very nice you know .  Really ?  And not expensive either .  Oh , I don't care about that .  Everybody is buying them .  Are they buying them ?  Yes , they are very fashionable , you see .  I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .  I see .  But thank you very much all the same .  Sorry I couldn't help you . 

Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning .  Where did he go ?  I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .  Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future .  Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .  Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work .  In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ?  That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ?  That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 

What is this big box at the front door ?  Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print .  What did you get yourself into ?  I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months .  So , what's in the box ? A fridge ?  It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is that I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes .  I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you read the fine print !  Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? 

What did you buy at the market ?  I bought some special local products .  You seem to have bought the whole market !  Yes . I really wanted to buy the whole market . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut .  Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals .  Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ?  All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes .  Then I will buy some tomorrow .  Why do you want to buy so much ?  Because I want to send them to my friends .  I see . 

What can I do for you ?  I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ?  I'd like to make a recommendation for you . How do you like the hat ?

Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ?  350 yuan .  OK . I'll take it . 

Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?  No , you do not have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance .  Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ?  Well , how old is your baby ?  No more than three .  The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand .  How about its quality ?  You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum .  OK , what is this ?  It is feeding-bottle as the free gift .  It is thoughtful . I will take it . 

I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open .  Why don't you go to bed ?  I think I will go to bed . 

I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you turn down the air conditioner ?  But then it'll be too warm .  Not if you take off your jacket . 

I need to buy some fruit .  All the fruit are pretty fresh here .  How much are the pears ?  They're four yuan per kilo .  Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ?  Yes , we do have fresh plums . They are eight yuan per kilo .  It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here .  Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo .

Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?  I am cooking now !  Are you good at cooking ?  I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !  It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !  I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?  Yes , I have tried steamed fish . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .  That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .  I have the same idea as yours .  It's OK . Please have a taste of it .  Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .  Thank you for your praise .  Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?  I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .  So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?  Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .  Thanks a lot .  It's my pleasure . 

Alright , tell me what you think about this one .  Don't you think it's a bit bright ?  Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?  That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?  No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .  I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .  How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?  That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?  That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .  Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?  Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?  That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?  The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . 

Won't you have some of this ?  Yes , thanks .  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .  It's very good . How do you make it ?  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .  This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .  I'm glad you like it .  You Americans usually have nutritious food .  Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?  We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .  I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did use a recipe . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 

Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?  Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .  Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .  I don't like milk , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .  Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?  Nothing .  What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .  Promise that you won't get angry .  OK , I promise . What is it ?  It's a kitty .  Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .  Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .  No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .  Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .  All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .  I will clean up everything it messes up . Thank you , Mummy . 

I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .  We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ?  The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .  Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it conveniently located ?  That's why I think it may suit my needs .  I believe it will suit your needs . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed .  The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ?  Yes . But not including the utilities .  Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ?  I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know .  Oh , that's no problem . 

Hello , who's that speaking ?  I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ?  Yes , I do have it now .  Is there any furniture in it ?  Yes , it's fully furnished .  What's the rent for a year ?  15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas .  Where is it located ?  It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station .  That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ?  The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ?  OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there .  All right , see you . 

Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ?  Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .  Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .  Right ? OK , got it .  Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?  Next left then right ? OK . 

What's the problem , sir ?  I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke .  Do you keep the receipt ?  Yes , and I have the warranty , too .

Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you have a pen ?  Sure , here you go .  Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .  Of course . There you are .  Thanks so much . I owe you one . 

Good evening .  Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim .  Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim .  But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon .  It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?  Well , it's a window table that we've booked .  I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .  Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one .  Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim .  If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here .  Yes , I will take him here . 

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .  We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .  I know , dear . I am tired of living in apartments too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .  We need to find a good realtor .  Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .  What do you mean ?  Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .  I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems .  Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  Sometimes they do have a realtor , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  Why ?  That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  It is very complicated . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .  I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .  All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . 

Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant .  Thank you .  Do you have a reservation ?  Yes , I do have a reservation .  May I have your name , please ?  Yes , it's Mr . Brown .  Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ?  Oh , this is just fine .  Please take a seat .  Thank you .  Here is the menu . 

Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month .  Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ?  Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ?  Not really .  What did you do for your last move ?  Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out .  Oh . that's very nice of him .  Yeah , it was very nice of him . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you .  Yes , please . 

What is your favorite coffee ?  Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it .  All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?  Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .  I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .  Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world .  I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?  Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  No , we don't drink coffee , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .  I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . 

Let's go to the cinema by bus .  Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient .  OK , it will be a new experience for me .  We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy .  Where do we pay the fare ?  Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket .  Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?  No , you don't have to pay an additional fare to change trains . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 

Let's have a look at the map first .  All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .  Let's buy some tickets .  The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train  Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it as crowded ?  No , but it will be crowded soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . 

For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon .  Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August . If you order one now , we will have it for you in August .  That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ?  We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .  My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord .  I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ?  Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ?  Yes , you can get that on the Accord . That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available .  Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car .  You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable .  Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk .  Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . 

Hi ! Do you want a fill-up ?  Yes , please .  Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ?  What's the price difference ?  Regular is $ 1.15 , Super is $ 1.25 and Premium is $ 1.39 .  Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .  Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ?  Yes , I would want you to check check the tires and the fluids . Thanks a lot . 

Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love.' It's interesting , isn't it interesting ?  I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ?  I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .  Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists .  Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable .  Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .  Seriously ?  Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did feel just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so .  Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .  Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine .  But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body . 

Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ?  No . This time I'll try Chinese wine .  What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head .  Do people here drink a lot of liquors ?  Some do drink a lot of liquors , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate .  Yes , it has something to do with the climate . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ?  Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon .  Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . )  Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on .  They say that Showing wine tastes quite good . What's it ?  It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China .  I see .  By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine .  Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time .  I'm always at your service . 

May I have your order now ?  Yes , we'd have your regular dinner . What courses are there ?  The courses for our regular dinner are , appetizer , soup , beef steak , dessert and coffee .  All right , we'll have it .  What kind of dessert do you want ?  Do you have some chocolate cakes ?  Yes , we have some chocolate cakes .  OK , we will choose it .

I still can't afford the car .  38000yuan is my final offer .  Hum ... OK . I will take it .

Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly .  Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ?  Yes , quite sure .  I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily , saying when and where you lost it .  But that takes too long .  Wait a minute ! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre . I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it . You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later .

It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky .  I didn't know you liked bird watching .  I don't really like bird watching .

Hi Anna , come in .  Wow , your apartment is a mess .  I know , I didn't have time to put things away before you got here .  Look ! Are those all your clothes on the couch ?  Yes .  Are they clean ?  Actually most of them are dirty . I haven't done laundry in a while . I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house .  My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ?  I know I should go there , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time .  Yes I know . I have to do it every week . Anyway , are you ready to go ?  No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ?  OK , but please hurry . I think the restaurant is closing soon .

I can tell you worked hard on it .  I really did work hard on it ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .  Well , it was definitely worth all the time .  Let's just hope my teacher agrees .

This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it the ticket line ?  Well , yes , it is , but ...  So , what's your beef anyway , lady ?  You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !  Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !  Just what gives you the right ... ?  Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .  Well , you're no gentleman , either .

What do you think about all the different diets people go on ?  I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !  But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ?  They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though .  So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?  Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert .  How about drinking soda ?  Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke .  That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ?  My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take vitamins anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start .  How do you know so much about food and dieting ?  You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 

Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?  I am wondering if you do facial care ?  Yes , we do facial care .  How much would it be ?  From 200 to 800 .  I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?  No problem .

That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode !  Are you still mad at her now ?  To be honest , I ’ m not mad at her , and I regret a little what I have done .  Will you apologize to her ?  No way . It ’ s her who should apologize .

We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters .  Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice .  Yes , we do have some of the masks that are made in Venice . They're on the wall behind you .  How much do they cost ?  The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ?  Yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle .  Here you go .

Oh , dear . My weight has gone up again .  I'm not surprised . You eat too much .  And I suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help .  Yes , I think so .  I do wish I could lose weight  Well , why don't you go on a diet ?  I've tried diets before but they've never worked .  Perhaps you should exercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class ?  Yes , maybe I should go to an exercise class . 

My stomach's growling again !  You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach .  Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ?  You want to be beautiful , don't you want to be beautiful ? Think about the butter and flour in ...  You're right . But if I get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again .  Most models only eat once a day . If they can do it , so can we do it .  You know . Soup , well , society makes us like this .  I think you're hallucinating ! What are you talking about ?  Well , thin is always " in " with the media .  And your point is what ?  if you aren't thin , you're nobody .  I agree with you , but I think people are pretty bad , too .  You lost me .  People are always gossiping about one another .  Yeah , but that's human nature .  We can be so critical of one another .  Let's change the stomach , I mean , the subject.How about some food ? 

May I help you ?  Yes , do you have sweaters ?  This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton .  You have quite a range , haven't you quite a range ? I would like to see some other styles . 

Can I help you ?  Yes , I want to buy a suit .  What about the red one ? It's the best seller .  Yeah , it's quite cute . I don't think it will fit me . I would prefer a darker color . Have you a black one ?  Yes , We have a black one . 

Can your dog do any tricks ?  Sure he can do tricks . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead .  I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks .  Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time .  So who takes care of him then ?  My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week .  I can't do that with my cat . She hates water .  You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . 

It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park .  Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym .  Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite .  That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride .  Look at the flowers over there . What are they ?  They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they cute ?  They are cute . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park .  I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond .

I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game !  Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me !  At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you obtained a very basic understanding of the game ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go .  I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it included in the four major arts of China ?  Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .  I know it is quite different from Western chess .  Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .  But isn't it the same with wiki ?  Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive .

Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on !  Thank you ! Guess how much it costs .  Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess .  Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five .  Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?  Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down .  How much did she ask for ?  Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty .  She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she fuming with anger ?  Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head .  Then you pretended to go without buying it ?  Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . '

I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other .  How many bathrooms would your dream home have ?  I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three .  How would you decorate your house ?  I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets .  How many TVs would your dream home have ?  I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .

Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?  Of course . Is the dinner still on ?  Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .  We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .  That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .  It can't be that bad .  I wish it wasn't that bad , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .  Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime .  Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better .  Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ?  When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation .  Has anything else happened to you ?  Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .  Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 

What do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .  I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .  Don ’ t worry .

Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people .  Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?  Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you have many formal events in your calendar ?  Come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at it , it's beautiful !  When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .  Maybe you have a point .  Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .  All right . How about this black skirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !  That's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .  Oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .  Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .  Why not try it on ?  It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?  Yes .  I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home .

How many would you like ?  I need 30 for my Christmas cards .  Are you sending them abroad ?  Twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .  Do you have any going anywhere in the EU ?

I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't treated you .  No way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .  Alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .  That's better .

Bye .  Bye . 

Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ?  Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name .  It's very thought-provoking , isn't it very thought-provoking ?  Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal .  So what do you think of the American fast food culture ?  I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States .  And everyone knows that America's favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it the hamburger ?  Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not .  But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants ..  What are they ?  Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich .  They're much better  But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived .  That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal .  Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods .  I suppose so . 

You like this china tea set , don't you like this china tea set ?  Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ?  Sure.How about the brown one ?  No , I don't like the brown one .

Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?  Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .  What ' the matter ?  The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .  Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .  That's true .  Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?  It was good . I brought lunch from home today .  You did bring lunch from home ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do get in America .  Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .  I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .  Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you believe fast food is our lifestyle ?  You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .  Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .  Seriously ?  Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .

Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ?  Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?  Do you have your receipt with you ?  Yes , I do have my receipt with me .  When did you buy it from our store ?  Four months ago .  I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .  But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .  Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .  Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .  You ’ re welcome .

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !  I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .  I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !  I told you we should have stayed in town today. The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow. Why did you want to come up here ?  I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .  Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?  I don't know .  I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .  What do you mean ?  We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .  I have plenty of gas .  Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working. We can't just let the car run and run. If we do let the car run and run , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .  So what can we do ?  Turn the lights off. Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour. That will conserve the heat as long as possible .  Alright . That's a good idea .  I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .  Days ?  Yes , it happens. That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .  Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .  Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !  What ? What did you buy ?  It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?  There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick .  And ?  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .  And it's a brick ?  Yes .  I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?  I wanted to open the box . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .  So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .  But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .  Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .  That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 

Can you help me now ?  No , but I'll be able to help you tomorrow .  That'll be too late .  Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ?  I did ask Bill , but he wasn't able to either . 

What're you doing now ?  I'm watching TV .  You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .  I will clean my teeth before I go to bed .  And don't ever forget it . 

Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ?  Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?  Of course , you have got to do those exams again. . You must try harder this time .  And must I go back to school ?  No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .  But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 .  You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .  What else I've got to do ? Join the army ?  Who knows ! That might come to later . 

Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .  What part hurts ?  The shoulder .  Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .  It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .  C'mon . Just don't move .  I'm bleeding too much .  We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we have a decent First Aid Kit ?  Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !  There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .  Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .  Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .  No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .  Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?  I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !  We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .  I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .  Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?  Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .  Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .  There . Stop ! 

Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened .  I feel kind of stupid .  Why ?  We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .  You got lost . You're kidding !  No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .  You could have called .  I know I could have called . But finally we asked someone where we were .  You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?  Guess where we ended up .  I don't know . Where ?  When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .  Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?  I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .  Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .  I know it is a dozen miles away from here . I don't know how it happened .  Hmm , maybe I do know how it happened .  What ?  Maybe I have an idea how it happened .  How ?  You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .  Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 

Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill .  I cannot tell you , Mum . Nobody can help me !  Come on . Let ’ s talk heart to heart . I think we can find a solution . 

Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .  I'm OK .  OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?  OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .  OK . Yeah ! Yeah !  First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .  Oh , OK . Wow !  OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .  Wow . That sounds really good .  Mm , it is really good .  Wow . What fillings do you recommend ?  Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . 

Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ?  There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ?  Great . Let's go . Where is it ?  Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too .  We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ?  I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms .  So let's go and catch earth worms !  OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go .  Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing .  That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today .  I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?  I suppose she did bring soy sauce for that . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one .  Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .  Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ?  Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . 

Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ?  You peel the onions and wash them , then chop them .  OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ?  Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there .  OK , got it .  What is your father doing now ?  Reading newspaper on the couch .  How about Daniel ?  Staying with Ultraman , of course . You know he likes it very much .  Be careful of the peeler . Don't cut your fingers .  I will Be careful of the peeler .  OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ?  OK ! 

We have a holiday next week , don't we have a holiday next week ?  Yes , on Monday .  What're you going to do ?  I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars .  At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you thinking about buying a car ?  Yes , I am thinking about buying a car . I'd like to be able to get around a little more .  But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it be expensive ?  Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days .  But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you park on the street ?  A lot of people do park on the street . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 

Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale .  Oh , she did tell you ? Then it's a used car of course .  Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car .  What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ?  She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles .  That's not bad . What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ?  Three thousand dollars .  Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ?  He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city .  Well , we can see it for ourselves . Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ?  No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 

Be quick . Put our bags in the deposit box .  We got a problem . The deposit boxes are all full . We should have come earlier .  I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it .  Did you tell me to hurry up ? I didn't hear you .  I surely did tell you to hurry up ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there .  They say we can't deposit our stuff there . They don't look after customers ' stuff .  It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping .  OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May .  That sounds like a good idea !  Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me .  What color do you want ?  Black , of course . 

Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled !  Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold .  Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ?  No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something .  Whatever . Have a drink of water .  Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already .  Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit .  Do we have a medicine-kit ? Where is it ?  Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it .  Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on .  Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no !  What's the new strike ?  Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration .  Poor me !

Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !  But I saw a red car always parking here before .  Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .  Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .  Yeah . It used to have a broken rearview mirror on the left . We got that fixed yesterday too .  Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .  Sure , go ahead .  Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .  That's all right . It's not your fault . 

I am sorry for damaging your car , sir .  Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies .  The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it over crowded ?  Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation .  There aren't enough buses in this city , are there enough buses in this city ?  Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor .  That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space .  Have you taken this to the property management , yet ?  No , but I'm gonna take this to the property management . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking .  Where ? On the road ?  No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed .  Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ?  Yes ! How do you know that ?  That's my wife !

What about taking a look around the theater ?  Why not ? I'd love to do that .  Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .  Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?  Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?  I surely do like the embroidery . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .  No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .  Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 

So how's everything going for Christmas ?  I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with .  What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .  No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus .  He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ?  Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ...  You think it's better that he should be told ?  Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do tell him .  That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real .  I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son .  Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that . 

What can I do ?  The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet .  Did you go to any illegal website ?  No , But does that matter ?

Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software .  Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ?  Of course . You'd better learn something about it .  I'm afraid yes, I should learn something about it . But what about the data I stored in the computer ?  Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ?  Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that .

How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?  There are four more stops .  Oh , my God !  What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !  Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?  No , not on the train , but in the station .  Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?

Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?  Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .  Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .  That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .  What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it a big store ?  Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .  So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?  Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .  Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will have it .  After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . 

Would you like to see our new shirts ?  Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things .  But they ’ re very nice , you know .  Really .  And not expensive either .

So can you fix it ?  I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do .  What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !  Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !  OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?  Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .

This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does freeze , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 

Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head !  What did I do ? I haven't done anything .  You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs .  What do you mean ?  You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody .  I didn't do anything .  We've found some heroin at your house .  No , I didn't do anything . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .  That may be the case , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking .  I don't need your help , jerk .  Whatever you say .

I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ?  That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room .  I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe .  You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom .  Yes , it would look good in my bedroom . It ’ s very expensive though .  Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store .  Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .  You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work .  That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .

We import a lot from other countries .  I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country .  We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket .  Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine .  A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . 

How do you use an ATM card , Billy ?  It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .  Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .  You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .  Ok , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ’ t I choose ?  Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .  I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?  That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .  These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 

Excuse me , can you tell me the way to Holton railway station ?  Sure . It ’ s quite far from here . Don ’ t worry , though . It ’ s not difficult to get there .  I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t I going in the wrong direction ?  Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ?  Yes , I do remember . They are about two miles away , right ?  That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel .  So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it .  Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you .  Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help .  No problem . 

Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful .  Oh no , I won't hit that car . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting .  You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful .  Oh , shut up , will you shut up ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened .  Oh , so it was my fault , was it my fault ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 

Hello , this is Rich .  Hi , Rich . Is Jim here ?  He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?  Sure I can tell him . This is Claire .  Does he have your telephone number ?  No , it ’ s 3725019281 .  3725015281 ?  No , it ’ s 3725019281 , it ’ s a 9 , not a 5 .  Right . I ’ ll have him call you back .  Can you tell him that it ’ s urgent ?  Sure can .  Thanks a lot .  No problem .  Bye .  Goodbye . 

They must have got in through the kitchen window .  If only we'd remember to close it .  I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling !  I wish I'd put it in the bank .  Look ! they've taken your fur coat too .  I know , I am sorry I ever bought it .  I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television .  It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company .  I wish we could claim for all this from the insurance company , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . 

Come on , darling . We haven't got much time .  All right . I'm nearly ready . What time does the bus leave ?  Half past six ... and it's half past six already .  Oh , we've got plenty of time .  We haven't got plenty of time . Hurry up !  All right . Let's go .  And about time too ! 

Come on ! It's time to go !  Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?  Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .  That won't take long .  Well , it won't take long if there no line at the pump .  Well , I'm not quite ready .  I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !  You wouldn't do a thing like that !  Oh , yes , I would do a thing like that ! 

Why aren't you doing your homework ?  I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday .  Oh , is that so ? You'll be making records next , will you be making records ?  We hope so .  You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday .  Oh dad . You don't understand at all .  I certainly could understand . You'll get exams next month .  I don't need it to play the guitar .  Oh , don't you need it to play the guitar ? God save me !  I'm sorry . 

Mom , may I play the card games for a while ?  Why do you want to play the card games ? Dad is in the study .  I won't make any noise . Mom , please .  Behave yourself ! Don't make any noise . Have you finished your homework ?  Yes , I ' Ve finished .  Then let me see .  er ... , mom , I promise . I won't make a single noise .  All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything .  Ok . I won't get into trouble .  Be careful !  Thanks for the warning , Mom . 

I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide .  Oh , I see . You ’ ve already decided , have you decided ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 .  I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference .  Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you think ?  I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 

Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ?  Yes , it really needs redecorating .  Shall I help you with it ?  I don ’ t suppose you could help me with it .  I have much time . I suppose it can be done .  I ’ ll be glad if you would help me with it . 

OK . Come back into the classroom , class .  Does the class start again , Mam ?  Yes , but to the heath , this break has last long enough .  Oh , breaktime flies .  come on , baby . It ’ s time now .  Mam , another minute , could I ?  Hurry up , little boy . 

So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it new ?  Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .  That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .  Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .  Did you buy new cupboards too ?  No , I didn ’ t buy new cupboards . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .  I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .  Yes , I have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .  Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food .  Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food .  Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .  I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 

We'd like to rent a flat near the university .  Are you looking for somewhere for two people ?  Yes , we are looking . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month .  Yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . Do you have any other requirements ?  Not really , no . We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street .  How many rooms do you need in the flat ?  We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .  Ok . I've got a list of place that fit your requirements . Let's just go through them . The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university .  How far away is it from the campus ?  It's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street .  That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .  Of course . I'm not very busy at the moment . If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . I can take you there .  Thank you . That would be great . 

I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?  Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .  I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .  The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .  Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .  It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .  Yes , it would be so nice . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine .  The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too .  Yes , everything has been well designed . 

So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ?  Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course !  So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ?  Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen .  What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook .  That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large .  Are the rooms nice and bright ?  Yes , they are nice and bright . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows .  Do you have a balcony ?  No , we don ’ t have a balcony . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly .  You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you on the edge of the city ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ?  It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? 

I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?  You look a bit pale , don't you look a bit pale ?  Yes , I can't sleep well every night .  You should get plenty of sleep .  I drink a lot of wine .  If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .  I often feel so tired .  You better do some exercise every morning .  I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .  Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 

I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ?  No , I haven ’ t seen it .  I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it .  Perhaps you left that at school .  No , I had it when I left school this afternoon .  Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there .  Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now .  But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library .  Perhaps I should call her later . 

Shall we have some soup first ?  No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with .  Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ?  Meat , I think .  Don't you like fish then ?  I do like fish , but I want meat .  Shall we have some white wine then ?  Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat .  What would you like for dessert ?  I just want to have a coffee , I think .  Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?  No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 

May I come in ?  Yeah , Please do come in . Now let me show you the house .  This seems a pretty nice room , I should say .  You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month .  What about the kitchen ?  It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too .  I see . I'd like to live here for about three years .  Terrific ! When are you moving in ?  Next Saturday at the earliest . 

Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ?  Of course . It's on Memorial Avenue .  On Memorial Avenue ?  Right . You know where that is ?  I'm afraid I don't know . I'm quite new in town .  Well , do you know where the post office is ?  No , I don't know . But I do know where the shopping mall is .  That won't help us . Let me see now ... Why don't you follow this street , Elm , until , you get to the second stoplight .  Well , thank you very much , I hope I can find it . 

Excuse me . Could you give me some directions ?  What are you looking for ?  A gas station . My car ran out of gas two blocks back .  Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light . Then turn right .  Do you know the name of the street ?  I can't remember , but it's the second light .  By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ?  I'm afraid I don't know . But I do know the price has gone up .  Thanks a lot . 

Excuse me . When's the next bus ?  The next bus will be here in four minutes .  Oh , good . That'll be the number forty four ?  No , it's the number fifty-eight .  So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ?  No , it won't be here soon .  So when will it be here then ?  Never .  Never ?  That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . It's stop is round the corner . 

where are you going , Jane ?  I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .  I saw her yesterday . She was a little better .  Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?  No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .  Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they run much more frequently ?  Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .  Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .  But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 

Then I'll have to borrow it .  Sure you can borrow it . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month .  Why ? It's in mint condition !  That's why I can profit from it !  You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ?  You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ...  I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 

Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem .  Why is that ?  Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do come back , they're never home .  And the downstairs neighbors ?  Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor .  Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . 

Johnny , I can't believe you would do that .  I know , Grandma , I just ...  You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here !  Yes I'm on housework duty .  You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !  Yes I'm on housework duty .  And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !  Yes I'm on housework duty . 

Why didn't you text me last night ?  What ? I sent you three or four messages !  I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message .  Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages .  Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month .  I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?  I do have an unlimited SMS plan , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages .  No wonder you didn't get my texts ! 

Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all .  Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring .  OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ?  Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi .  Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course .  Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ?  No , I don't think it will go well . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish .  I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ?  Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand .  Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ?  That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay .  Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now .  It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely .  All right . What varietal is that ?  Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess .  And you think this is a good wine ?  Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma .  Perfect ! I'll take it ! 

Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ?  I can't catch a movie , I have to go to the gym .  Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !  Actually I will get in trouble ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy .  That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?  Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats .  Sounds like you are really getting in shape ! 

Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much .  Are you looking for anything else ?  Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous .  That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want .  Really ? No , no , I couldn't have it ! You're too nice !  And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them .  Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much . 

Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals .  No , thank you , I am not interested .  Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you !  I wish I could spare five minutes , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me .  We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !  Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ?  Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !  Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications .  You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters !  That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 

We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?  I will look after a dog or a cat ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !  What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .  Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?  We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .  Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !  I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .  Yay ! 

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?  It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine .  Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops .  Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t have the luxury . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .  True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?  Not funny . 

Hey , what are you doing here ?  I'm just shopping .  What are you shopping for ?  Some new clothes . How about you ?  Same here .  Have you found anything nice yet ?  I found a few pairs of pants .  Where'd you get those ?  I found them at Pennies .  Those are really cute .  Do you want me to show you where I found them ?  I would like you to show me . Thank you . 

Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce .  You might want to try the mangoes .  Can you describe a mango to me ?  It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it .  Do I eat the seed ?  Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't eat the seed . You'd have to soak it for 10 years .  What's the price of these mangoes ?  Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each .  Tell me what they taste like .  Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet .  Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ?  Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat .  Where do mangoes come from ?  These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . 

Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?  Sorry , I can ’ t come ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .  You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run some errands .  Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have someone to help me out , though .  I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids .  Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while . 

I need to order new business cards .  Do you have any idea how many you'd like ?  I think 2,000 would be enough .  Would you fill out this form , please ?  Sure, I can fill out this form .

I'm searching for an old music box .  You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?  If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .  We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .  Would any of them have dancing figures ?  Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .  Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .  That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it beautiful ?  One last question  Oh , no . Everything we sell here is " as is .

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these .  There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing .

Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .  I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .  I didn't think you did sell out of the saucepans , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .  Well , it's all new stock in the window now .  May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?  Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .  Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .  Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .  Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .  That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .  There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .

I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .  Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?  Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .  That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?  Just a minute, go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .  What do you use your computer for ?  I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you  Computers are great , aren ’ t they great ?

I just ran a search for music to download .  I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .  Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net .  When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?  Yes , I did attach files . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .  When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do give out your email address , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .  That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .  That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time  How do I do that ?  Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together .

So , you ’ re online eight hours a day .  Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .  How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?  I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .  How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?  What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .

No , I didn't save . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .  I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save .

Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ?  Yes , yes I did call . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !  I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .  Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .  Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .  That would be great ! Is it expensive ?  Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . 

We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !  Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !  Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?  I will look after a dog or a cat ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day !

Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?  Sorry , I can ’ t come ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .  You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so  Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to hire a nanny .  I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great  Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow .

I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious !  I was worried you would think it was too far to drive .  Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch. But really , I think it's worth it .  I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer .  How do you mean ' suffer ' ?  I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food. So we miss the food in Taiwan too much. Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better .  Even in the winter ?  Yes , even in the winter .  And even if it takes two hours , huh ?  Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza !  Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .  Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese !  I know it is very important . I can see that . This is what is called ' dim sum ' ,  right ?  Yes , all these dishes are different ' dim sum ' dishes. You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America .  So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ?  Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment .  And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants .  No way !  What do you mean ?  We're going up to the ' new ' Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go .  Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ?  No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the ' new ' Chinatown .  Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ?  No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan .  I wonder if you can cook things this good .  I'm a great cook actually . You will see . 

Why don't you watch where you're going ?  Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !  There was plenty of room for me to pull out. You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .  Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in. You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out. And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes. All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .  I think my arm is broken .  Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .  Listen , let's just wait until the police get here. Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .  Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .  I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?  Alright .  It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .  Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .  Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .  Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .  It really hurts .  Yes , maybe it does hurt . But if you're going to drive like you did drive just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?  To hell with you . The accident was your fault .  I'm afraid it wasn't my fault . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't my fault . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone. Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?  To hell with you . 

Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless !  I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second .  This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now !  Alright , alright . I ’ m coming .  Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight. You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted .  You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .  Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?  Of course, I can pick up a bottle of wine . Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good !  Great ! Can you set the table ?  Just a sec,  I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast .  Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ! 

I really appreciate your driving me around .  It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place .  It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all .  So what do you see in there ?  This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .  Can you afford that much ?  No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it what I want ? An efficiency .  Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person .  How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ?  That means the apartment has furniture in it .  That's good .  Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture .  Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 .  It's still pretty expensive .  Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one .  Alright . What's the phone number ?  256-7797 .  Got it . What else do you see ?  This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ?  No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom .  That sounds alright .  Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them .  Here's the number , 256-4367 .  Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .  Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this .  Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? 

Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .  What part hurts ?  The shoulder .  Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .  It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .  C'mon . Just don't move .  I'm bleeding too much .  We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we have a decent First Aid Kit ?  Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !  There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .  Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .  Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .  No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .  Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?  I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !  We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .  I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .  Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?  Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .  Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .  There . Stop ! 

I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from .  I would like to rent a car with a good stereo .  All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us .  Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time .  Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot .  This is a Porsche !  Yes . Beautiful , isn't it beautiful ?  But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive .  Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars .  But how can you do that ?  It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it in nice shape ?  Yes , it almost looks new . 

I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side. Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?  Alright .  It doesn't work .

Do you have another one ?  I do have another one . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .  Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 

Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ?  Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale .

It ’ s on sale , isn't it on sale ?  Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain .  I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ?  Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ?  It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters .  I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better .  OK . I like the design of this lamps .

Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ?  It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ?  The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements .

Gino , do you really need to go ?  Yeah , it's must for me .  But don't forget to give me a ring .  I won't forget , mom .  Take care of yourself .  I will take care . Bye , mom .  Bye , my boy . 

Look ! There are playing The Matrix today .  You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ?  I don't know . If we can't get tickets , we can buy from ticket scalpers .  No way . I'd rather go to another movie house .  Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture .  All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ?  Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line !  Shall we take a chance ?  Yeah , let's do so .  It's moving so slow .

You don't want to miss the plane , do you want to miss the plane ?  I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ?  Name it and I'll do it for you .  Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything .  I've got it .  Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .  I am just doing what I think I should do .  Thank you for being a friend of mine .  This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business .  Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her .

I am so happy for them .  Are you crying ?  Yes , I always cry at weddings .  Harris and Anne are perfect for each other .  Yes , they are perfect .  You and Tom also make a great couple .  In fact , we are beginning to make preparations .  For the wedding ?  No , no , for the engagement .  Try to catch this bouquet then . 

Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking .  Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues .  But what are the sources of water pollution ?  They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources .  Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc , aren't they the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc ?  Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies .  But what about the indirect ones ?  Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater .  I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .  Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 

Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world .  Yes , they do seem . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married .  People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them .  Nothing seems to be happier for them . 

I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you .  Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again .  How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you !  Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you know ? Just give me one more chance , please ! 

Are you a happy married man ?  Yes , I am a happy married man . My wife and I understand each other .  You are a lucky man . How about Mr. Smith .  I don't know . But they say that Mrs. Smith wears the pants in the house .  You mean she bosses her husband around ?  That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . 

Hi , Mike . We're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend .  Well . I am breaking up with Cathy .  What happened ? Did you have a fight ?  No . She is really a very nice girl ...  Yeah , she is really a very nice girl . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem .  Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she's just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself .  Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ?  I've tried , but it didn't work .  So , when are you going to tell her ?  Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her .  I know she's head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt !  I know ... 

Hi , Is that David ?  Hi , Jenny . It's David here .  Hey , what's new ?  Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me .  Sorry to hear that . What happened ?  Well , she told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue .  Hey , that's not the girl with pink hair , is it the girl with the pink hair ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday .  What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser .  Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her .  But she lied to me .  Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ?  okay , then .  But you have to promise me that you are not going to wear that face .  What face ?  The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better .  Yeah , I know . You are right . 

Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ?  Yes , I am coming . When is the wedding ?  Aug 8 .  August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ?  Mrs. White .

The wedding will be held at her church , right ?  Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding .  Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ?  Yes , Jane says they will go to China . 

Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ?  I don't know . You know what they say about office romances .  No , I don't know . What do they say about office romances ?  They say you shouldn't mix love and work .  That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else's business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here .  You'Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me .  People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact .  That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity .  If it does affect your productivity , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other .  You are sounding like we are already married .  Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry .  Well , I don't feel right about it .  I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime .  Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ?  I like company .  Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus !  What can I say ? I am a passionate guy .  Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about .  You want to go out with me and you know it .  In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do .  okay , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? 

Tom , did you see the film last night ?  Yes , I did see the film last night , I thought it was a failure .  Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ?  Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion .  Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . 

Hello !  Oh , hi !  Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom .  Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ?  Yes , I did move in next door . Have you lived here long ?  Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ?  No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ?  I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ?  I am an accountant at a company  Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college .  It's nice meeting you too , Alice .  See you around !  Goodbye , Alice . 

Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea .  It's easy to get loose bowels in summer .  It may have something to do with the food I had last night  You'Ve got to be careful on the food you eat .  I will be careful . Thank you . 

Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen .  I had to go get a cavity filled today .  Did it hurt ?  I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me !  How long were you in the chair ?  It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots .  Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth .  No kidding . Not only can't I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous !  Don't you have a dental insurance ?  I do have a dental insurance , but it still does not cover everything . 

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck .  Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ?  Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck .  Yeah , I don't mind it either . We'll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do need it , you know ?  Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we'll have a monthly check when we get old .  Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive .  Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it .  Really ? No , they couldn't figure out . None of them would have jobs if they did figure out . 

What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?  We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River .  How hard is the climb ?  It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .  What did you do last week ?  We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting .  Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it .  Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .  Yeah , I will do the climb . See you then !  okay , see you .

I wish you wanted to relax everyday .  Dream on ! 

It's a perfect day for swimming .  I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ?  Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill's party ..  Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you want a sunburn ?  No . Thanks for reminding me . 

Aren't you going to swim ?  Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ?  You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you telling me ?  Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we'Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now .  What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ?  Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit .  All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming .  Jim !  Yes ?  Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand .  I've got a better idea . Why don't we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ?  Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! 

So how did you meet Bill ?  I met him through a computer bulletin board .  Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ?  It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 .  I've heard about that , but I've never tried it .  You ought to try it . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .  I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers .  That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can't see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn't talk to .  I just want a private conversation with one other person .  You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can't see them .  Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk .  That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line .  It's that popular ?  It sure is that popular . 

Good morning , Jim !  Good morning , Emma ! Today is lovely day , isn't it a lovely day ?  Yes , it is a lovely day . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze .  It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ?  We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ?  What did the whetherman say ?  He's predicting clear skies .  Well , I will think it over . 

Did you hear how cold it got last night ?  I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero .  It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car .  My car didn't want to start either at first .  Don't you have a garage ?  Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot .  How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero .  I do keep it . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero .  Does it ever get that cold on here ?  Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below .  Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . 

Her dress looks funny .  I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me .  Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year .  Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her .  Well , you're really as outdated as she is outdated .  You're darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style  No wonder you never buy me a new dress . 

Lily , do you know Lizzy ?  Lizzy who ?  Lizzy smith .  Of course I do know Lizzy .  Then , Do you know her younger sister ?  You mean Mary ?  Yes .  Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary .  Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ?  Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too .  That sounds terrific .  Why do you ask me these questions ?  I just want to visit the family some day . 

Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .  You do have a passion for Chinese literature ?  Yeah , those classics from the great writers .  But I find Japanese ones better . 

Hi , David ! What are you doing ?  Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ?  Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ...  Neither am I good at tennis . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club .  Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in .  Well ... What are you interested in ?  How about the Classical Music Club ?  Joanna , give me a break .  Hey-how about the Cinema Club ?  Sounds okay to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! 

Have you ever made any plan for your future ?  Of course I have made a plan for my future . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible .  Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever .  I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs. Right . 

Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ?  Yes .  Did you use to work at NYU ?  Yes , I did used to work at NYU .  Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student .  Hugh Young ? Didn't he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?  Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university .  I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he's doing now ?  Yes , he's a millionaire in Houston now .  A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?  Oh , no . He's an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .  Well ! I guess people don't find him so peculiar anymore . 

You really should stop smoking , you know .  I know . I know . I don't smoke too much , though .  How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ?  About a pack , more if I drink .  Wow . You're really a heavy smoker .  No , I'm not really a heavy smoker . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years .  He died of lung cancer , right ?  Yeah ... you're right . I really should stop smoking . 

Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ?  Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs. Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to come .  How about tomorrow afternoon ?  Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . 

I went to Rotes', you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths .  Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician .  I'm so thirsty .  Are you thirsty ? I thought you had something to drink at her home .  No . Edith didn't give anything to drink .  I'll buy you a drink .  Oh ! Thank you . 

Aren't you staying for the party ?  No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow .  I don't blame you for getting some rest .  Yeah . I need to get some rest . 

Why don't we Chinese have our own Valentine's Day ?  Of course we have our own Valentine's Day . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month .  Oh ? Why is that day ?  It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . 

Do you think Mr. Johnson is a good worker ?  Just between you and me , I think he's lazy .  Haven't you ever seen him working late ?  No , I haven't seen him . 

Here's 30 yuan for my ticket .  Keep it . I'm buying tonight .  No , you can't do that .  Sure I can do that , my treat . 

Is there something wrong ? You look so sad .  My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .  No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ?  Yes , I have called the police . But I have to wait . 

Well , speak of the devil .  What do you mean ?  I was just thinking about you the other day .  You were thinking about me the other day ? 

Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time .  I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime .  Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party .  I will tell my wife . See you later . 

Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ?  As a matter of fact , I have run into my cousin Jimmy . I ran into him just the other day .  How's he doing ?  Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week .  He did have four teeth pulled last week ? That's too bad !  I think so , too .  Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him .  I'll be sure to do that . 

So , what's new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn't it new ?  Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one .  That's usual nowadays . You'Ve added a few shelves too .  Yes . You know I'Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients .  Did you buy new cupboards too ?  No , I didn't buy new cupboards . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added .  I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .  Yes , I have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . I need them to help me with these new dished I'm trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over .  Looking at the spice rack , I'd say you'Ve been learning how to make asian food .  Yes . I'Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I'Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I'm pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food .  Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it's very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket .  I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig !

Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive .

It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder .  I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing .  Well , it may rain again later today .  Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in .  There may also be a strong wind coming in .  It'll be dusty , too , I guess .  Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing .  Why is that ?  We've been planting trees for many years .  I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful .  But the summer isn't really beautiful . It's scorching in the summer .  Then what about spring ?  Spring is warm and short in Beijing .  It must be cold in the winter , though .  You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year .

Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there .  So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously .  I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down .  Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ?  I wanted to go swimming , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees .  It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that .  It looks like you could use it . Don't tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 

What ?  What happened with that guy at the cafe ?  nothing  But you're crazy about him ?  Yes , I am crazy about him .  Why don't you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?

Is this your umbrella , miss ?  Oh , yes , it is my umbrella . Thank you . I was looking for it just now .  You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before .  Have you ?  May I ask where you live ?  Just two blocks away , in that tall building .  That's it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor .  My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor .  It's a small world ! May I know your name , miss ?  I'm Chen Ming .  How do you do , Miss Chen ? I'm Song Mei .  I'm glad to meet you , Mr. Song .  Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ?  No , I'm going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . 

Elaine's back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she's not good enough for you , is that it ?  Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along .  How do you know ? You haven't seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .  That has nothing to do with it ...  I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson that you're too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don't go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ...  I do refuse to take her out .  Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson's over for dinner on Thursday . 

I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting .  Neither can I believe . 

Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ?  Of course . Are you a new member here ?  Yes .  Welcome . My name is Johnson .  Nice to meet you .  Do you have any experience using weights ?  No , I don't have any experience . So I need some help .  Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines .  Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines .  Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you .  What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one .  No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you .  I'm ready .  Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine .  I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress .  Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you .  Alright . Great .  So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here .  Great . Why don't we start on the machines ?  Are you alright ? Can you do more ?  I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted .  That's okay . Don't worry.It's important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning .  What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines .  We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ?  Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . 

I think I'm going to go home .  Why ? We just got here .  I know , but it's 12  12  Three or four o'clock ?  Yes .  I never stay out that late . That's too late .  But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ?  Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ?  Yes , I was wild . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does .  What is that they're doing on the couch ?  They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it .  Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ?  Yes , it is marijuana .  But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail .  Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine .  Really ?  Yes .  I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ?  I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don't worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to smoke pot .  I don't want to smoke pot .  That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon .  I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks .  You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink .  I thought a university was for studying .  It is for studying . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live .  Alright . I'll have another drink . 

I am kind of nervous .  Nervous ? Why ?  I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do .  Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it .  Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it .  Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen .  Really ?  Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that .  Alright . But will we sing ?  Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can sing along .  I don't know the words .  There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words .  And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?  No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist .  Eu-char-ist ? What is that ?  That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist .  It doesn't sound like an English word .  It's not an English word . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude .  Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor .  Of course you are welcome . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . 

So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year .  Did Mr. Lin put you in charge of marketing ?  He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office .  Where will it be ?  We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea .  Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ?  Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It's going to be good . We can compete more directly with them .  Great .  Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile .  You seem excited about it .  Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team .  Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there .  Yes , I do think . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market .  The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ?  It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial .  Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving .  That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it .  Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . 

Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family .  Why would that be funny ?  Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to go , but because we want to .  Why ?  We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .  I don't agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself .  What's the point ? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It's pointless .  Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .  What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in .  Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !  Yeah , yeah , whatever . 

Man , I'm freaking out ! You gotta help me !  Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you're sweating like a pig ! What's going on ?  I can't go through with this ! I just can't go through with this ! I'm not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I'm only thirty five years old ! I'Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can't settle down yet !  What are you talking about ? It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family !  I know . I know !  Let's think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it !  You're right . I'm being crazy ! okay , I'm ready , let's do this !  Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you . 

Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you okay ?  I don't know . I didn't really feel like going out . I guess I'm feeling a little homesick .  Come on.We'Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were going to try and deal with it .  I was going to try and deal with it . It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare . I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom's cooking and being around my family .  Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it .  I see what you mean , but I'm still bummed out .  okay . how does this sound . let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !  You know , I could really go for that . You don't mind being my wingman for tonight ?  Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys'night out ... well kinda ...  Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don't let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it's not a pretty picture ! 

Tom , aren't you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ?  What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?  Of course , I did dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night .  Whatever , I'm going next door I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 

Who are those guys ?  Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers'star players .  Oh .  Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !  All right !  Here comes Jordan , though .  Wow , Michael Jordan's slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .  Yeah . He's older , so he doesn't slam , as much as he did slam when he was younger , but when he does , it's still amazing .  Which team do you think will win ?  The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 

What's the Mountaineering Club doing this Sunday?  We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .  How hard is the climb ?  It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .  What did you do last week ?  We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .  Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I'm sorry I missed it .  Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .  Yeah , I will do the climb . See you then !  O . K . See you . 

Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?  Yeah , I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .  Oh , do you go hiking often ?  I go as much as I can go . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .  It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?  Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?  Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .  Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .  Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .  Well , bring him along too . We'll have a great time this weekend .  Thanks , I'll ask him . 

Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ?  No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today .  I try to do that , but I can't get up early enough .  I couldn't get up early enough either at first , but you get used to it .  It's so hot at lunchtime ; I'd rather run in the morning .  Well , why don't you come tomorrow ? I'll stop by your house on my way out .  I could try , but I can't say for sure if I'll get up in time . What time do you want to go ?  I'll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty .  O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I'll be able to get up in time for a jog .  Great , I'll see you then .  See you . 

Thank god you showed up when you did show up ! He's insane ! Do you think we should call the police ?  Don't worry about it , I'll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can't believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job !  I know ! Well ... he said I'm not pregnant . I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose ...  Don't apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.And now that I'm with you again , I'm ... I'm just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can't handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ?  Just hold me ... I'll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven .  I'm so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . 

All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too !  Over my dead body you are going out ! 

I never understand why these shops have so much liquor .  What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free .  But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .  Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .  You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?  Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?  No , I didn't know that . How high is the tax ?  Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .  Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?  Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it .  That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it why ?  Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . 

... so , I said , let's take a break.And since that night , I'Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven't heard from him . You don't think he's seeing someone else , do you think ?  Come on , don't be so dramatic ! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine .  You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I'm sure he's cheating on me ! Why else wouldn't he call ?  But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .  He's the love of my life ! I'Ve really messed this up .  Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It's going to be alright .  But I ... I still love him ! And it's all my fault ! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I'Ve totally messed this up !  You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I'm sure he'll forgive you ...  No , this is not going to happen ! I ... I'Ve ruined everything ...  do you hear something ? 

What do you want to do tomorrow night ?  What--is tomorrow night something special ?  It's Friday . We should go party .  I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know .  okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .  Do you feel like dancing ?  Yes ? Why not ?  Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends .  They aren't alcoholic !  No , maybe they're not alcoholic . But they're close .  So where should we go ?  Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night .  You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar .  The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ?  It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night .  No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you .  It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ?  Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there .  No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch !  It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ?  Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .  Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you have to learn some Spanish ?  Maybe . 

I heard you were teaching English over there . Tell me about it . Did you like it ?  Oh , yes , it was very interesting .  What were the schools like ?  Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes .  But you taught children , yes ?  Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America . At least as far as studying is concerned . Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school .  They actually study after school ?  That's right . After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English . They are very serious about learning over there .  Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ?  Of course they do relax . You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much . But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing . Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are concerned . And that is good . American kids don't study enough .  Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that .  So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education . They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing . In America , too many parents don't pay attention .  But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .  As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it . And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience .  Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ?  That's a stereotype we Americans have . We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet . But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too .  Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also . Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ?  I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults . So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 

How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ?  No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want .  I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot .  Yes , they do depend on trains a lot . I wish we Americans had a better train system .  I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much .  I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains .  It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars .  Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people .  Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change .  Why do you say " have to " ?  Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .  Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important .  Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It's almost noon . I have to get home .  Do you want me to give you a ride ?  No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner .  Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you .  See you around . 

What's your city like ?  It's quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls .  Is the traffic bad in the city centre ?  Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good .  What about restaurants and entertainment ?  There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s  Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?  There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas .  It sounds like a really exciting city to live in .  It is really exciting . I hope you'll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there's more happening outdoors . 

Do you believe in UFO's ?  Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .  I've never thought about it like that before .  I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .  Do you think that there's life on other planets ?  I think there must be life on other planets .  Why is that ?  I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that .  Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?  No , but we're trying to contact them .  I suppose you're right .  I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct .  Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?  There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will destroy Earth , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 

Hello , Jim . What was the film like ?  Awful . It was a complete waste of time .  Why ? What was it about ?  It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .  A lot of young people have to do that .  Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .  lt sounds like the story of my life .  Yes , it does sounds like the story of my life , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night .  I take sleeping pills sometimes .  Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .  It sounds a very depressing film .  Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months'work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end ,  I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up .

Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?  yes , it is true . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .  good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .  yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...  is everything ready now ?  almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .  have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .  yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .  it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .  that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .  I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .  thank you .  my pleasure . 

have you ever been to Disneyworld ?  when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?  the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .  that's right . Why do you ask ?  well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .  when are you getting married ?  some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .  congratulations ! I had no idea .  thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?  do you like amusement parks ?  for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .  if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can go on , you'll have a good time .  even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?  even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .  thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .  I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 

Jack and Mary broke up .  it's so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ?  Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .  really ? I'm very surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever do that sort of thing , right ?  no , he doesn't look like a guy who'd ever do that sort of thing . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time .  maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .  how so ?  he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them .  poor Mary ! She really liked him .  anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better .  do you think they'll get back together ?  no , I don't think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won't change her mind .  I hope she'll recover soon .  so do I . 

how's it going ?  I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ?  to be honest , I'm a bit fed up .  what's wrong ?  well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did call me .  that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it .  the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't do it .  I see how that can get a bit annoying .  a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would phone me ! He's such a liar .  so what are you going to do about it ?  I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him .  what do you think would make you happier ?  in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .  relationships can be confusing sometimes .  what would you do if you were me ?  I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! 

so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ?  I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ?  I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ?  camping for an evening is okay , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night !  have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ?  no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go .  it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place .  do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ?  sure , would you like to see them ?  that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ?  I have a Canon SLR .  so , you must be pretty interested in photography then .  I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ?  actually , I do know much about photography . I took quite a few photography classes at University .  have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ?  yes , I was planning on going . Are you planning on going ?  yes.In fact , maybe we could go together .  that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ?  how about at 11:00 ?  sounds great . see you then . 

what sort of music do you like ?  I love just about anything by Prince .  so , you're into 80s music then ?  well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ?  I like alternative music .  do you have a favorite band ?  to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to .  do you often go to concerts ?  I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ?  I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ?  there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me .  I'd love to come along , but I have a night class on Thursdays .  that's too bad . Maybe another time .  let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then .  I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ?  sure , what's on ?  there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .  that sounds dreadful ! 

Did you enjoy that new movie ?  That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon .  Oh , what happened , Carole ?  I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it .  What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming .  Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he get around ?  Looks like it . So how did he handle it ?  His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again .  I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed okay to me .  I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy .  Doesn't sound promising .  Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug .  If you want I'll let him know if I run into him .  Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . 

Hi , Mike , what gives ?  Hi , Bill , this is my new car .  Hey , great set of wheels .  You like it , huh ?  Who wouldn't like it ? Wow , that's out of this world .  It is special , isn't it special ?  Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?  Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .  I can imagine .  Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out .  I'd love to try it out .  okay , let's go . 

good morning !  good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?  I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares !  that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did look yesterday .  I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something .  what's that ?  well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic .  that's annoying , but nothing to worry about .  for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ?  just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset .  okay , I'll try that .  is there anything else bothering you ?  just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do .  do you have any other plans this weekend ?  I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday .  try not to take on more than you can handle .  you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 

it's a lovely day , isn't it a lovely day ?  yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice .  is she American ?  yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams !  so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?  I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her .  sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ?  not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby .  that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?  you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .  good luck !  thanks ! 

Have you heard about the new iPhone ?  yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ?  I'd like to get one . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one .  if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods .  how big is a shuffle iPod ?  the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first .  how many gigs of music can it hold ?  I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember .  how much do they cost ?  not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars .  you're right , that's not bad at all .  do you have an iPod ?  I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one .  why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ?  that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 

what are you looking for ?  I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer .  do you know what camcorder options are available ?  not really . I thought I'd just have a look today .  would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?  sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first .  okay . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ?  it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ?  it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes .  can you also take still photos with this ?  yes , that is an option .  how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ?  yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark .  that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ?  It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera .  how does that compare with other models ?  there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one .  I guess you can't have everything , can you have everything ? 

Is that your phone ?  yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ?  it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ?  yes , it's got wireless Internet access .  that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ?  yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ?  no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go .  yes , I guess I should try to use it .  does it have a camera ?  of course it does have a camera . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ?  I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client .  sure . Here you go .  have you checked your voicemail recently ?  no , why ?  I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .  oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet .  do you want to listen to your messages first ?  no , it's okay . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later .  I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone .  I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ?  it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet .  how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ?  it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time !  let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! 

could we possibly discuss my salary some time ?  sure .  first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ?  well , you are a very hard-worker .  I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent .  there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ?  I could really use a 5 % rise .  that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise .  listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities .  that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it .  that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ?  of course . It's be against the law if we didn't get over-time .  that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it .  you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . 

do you mind if I sit here ?  no , of course not . Go ahead .  don't I know you ?  yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school .  you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time !  What did you do after high school ?  I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ?  I took a year off to go travelling .  that sounds exciting . Where did you go ?  I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ?  I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department .  Oh , did you study a foreign language ?  yes , I got a grant to study Chinese .  that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it very difficult ?  it is very difficult , but it's very rewarding .  so you can speak Chinese ?  I can speak Chinese , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die !  I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . 

I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend .  oh .  don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ?  sure .  I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a  the train ? Will I be flying back then ?  oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable .  will the train be very crowded ?  oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine .  when is the first meeting then ?  they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower .  where will I be staying ?  we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .  that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ?  that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can have a nap . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 

i , how are you doing ?  everything's great . And you ?  same here . Have you seen any new films recently ?  no , I haven't had a chance to seen any new films recently . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce .  oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking .  yeah . I found it is so close to our life .  it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world .  you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years .  well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too .  I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married .  oh , that's too short-lived .  that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation .  I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage .  definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .  in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .  I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . 

Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?  I'd love to see this movie , the movies are smash hit .  Then let's go in .  I can't go in . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .  I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .  I know . I wonder what's keeping him .  Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he done this before ?  Yeah , a number of times .  What's he trying to pull anyway .  I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .  Maybe you should start seeing someone else .  You said it . okay , let's go in , Sandy . 

hi , betty !  hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ?  pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great .  that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ?  well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don  that's really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work .  indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees .  that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that .  true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything .  well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good .  yeah it is really good . 

hi , Natasha , how's life ?  great . My family came to visit me .  oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ?  my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me .  I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me .  I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ?  yes , it did practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .  interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ?  the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da  do you get along well with each other ?  yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot .  you are very lucky to have such a nice family .  thank you . 

what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ?  to be honest , I wouldn't choose to have no kids .  why ? Do you have to make a choice now ?  not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time .  what's the puzzle ?  my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids .  oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way .  yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night .  oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .  but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not .  definitely .  you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness .  don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .  I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child .  sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 

what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?  my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .  three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !  well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .  were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?  I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn't afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .  did your husband's family get to meet your family ?  my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t  that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?  we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .  you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you have a traditional wedding ?  not at all , but we don't have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 

you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander .  thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight .  how did you meet each other ?  she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party .  is this your first date ?  yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily .  sure it will pan out . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date .  oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ?  absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history !  then who will you meet tonight ?  a guy I met on the internet three month ago .  really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ?  please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday .  I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . 

How many people are there in your family ?  There are 15 people in my family .  What did you say ? How many ?  15 people .  Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ?  Of course we do live together ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me .  But you don't live at home anymore .  Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home .  My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house .  Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis  Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent !  My aunts and uncles are all teachers .  You are so lucky !  I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year .  That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time .  I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English .  800 books ? I'm impressed !  My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That's what they learn here in America . 

Hi , Fanny .  Hi , Andy .  Are you feeling okay ? You sound a little tired this morning .  I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night .  What happened ?  I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood .  Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ?  My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help .  You have got a great mother .  I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk .  That sounds good !  Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan .  Me too . But I tell myself that if they don't accept me , another school will accept me . 

Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ?  Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ?  He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish  Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they work hard ? Does he like it ?  School , you mean ? Yes , he does like it . He likes his teachers , and that always makes a difference .  Yes , it does make a difference . Does he go to school by bus ?  No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together .  What does he do when it rains ?  My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . 

who is your favorite NBA star ?  Kobe Bryant , of course .  Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .  He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand .  Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ?  indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit .  Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ?  who wouldn't go to the match between China and USA ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him .  well then , what are your spoils ?  well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 

Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ?  Yes , I am going to leave school at the end of the term .  What are you going to do ?  I'm going to be a clerk .  What does a clerk do ?  He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types .  I want to be a vet .  A-what ?  A vet-a veterinary surgeon .  Good gracious ! What's that ?  A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor .  I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . 

If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world .  Would you go round the world ? I wouldn't go round the world .  What would you do ?  Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money .  One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more .  Why wouldn't you work ? What would you do with all that spare time ?  As I said , I'd go round the world .  What would you do after that ?  Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world .  It doesn't sound very exciting .  Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there a point ?  I'd be happy if I got a rise .  And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat .  Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't got the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink .  What'll you have ?  I'll have a pint of the best .  I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it .  All right . Make it a double , will you make it a double ? 

Did you hear that they are going to start an exercise class after work ?  Oh really ? When is it going to start ?  Next month . I think . Are you going to sign up ?  Well , I'd like to sign up , but I'm going to have to look at my schedule . 

You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !  Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .  They were supposed to get me an assistant , but so far nobody's turned up , and I'm left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I'Ve had all day .  They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 

Has your son started school yet , Tom ?  Next week , it's going to be quite a shock for him !  He'll get used to it . They always do get used to it . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?  You bet . I wouldn't miss it ! 

John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I've got some good news !  Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning .  I am happy . Don't worry about getting your wallet . It's my treat .  This is a first ! You must have won the lottery . 

I had a great time on the last date .  Me , too .  What will you up to this weekend ?  Nothing .  would you like to go to skating ? I was thinking of going out to the - - Saturday . It's great up there . Would you like to go with me ?  I'd love to go out with you , but I don't care for skating very much .  okay , there is a bunch of going bowling on Sunday . Would you like to go ?  I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you .  Would you like to dancing tonight ?  I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart .  I miss you too . Tell me where you like to do the next day .  How about the seaside ?  Anything you say , honey .  Are you busy on the 24th ?  24th ? I have time . But I can't wait that long , I'm dying to see you . Let's make another time .  okay . 

Let me take care of the check today .  Why ? It's unfair . How about going dutch ?  You paid the last time , because I didn't have any money , remember ?  Oh , come on , I almost forgot . Don't worry about it . I didn't mind picking up the tab last time .  But you really should let me treat one time , I feel like I owe you one if I didn't treat one time .  okay , but it's only for this time .  What's the damage ?  It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together . But don't forget the tip , it usually 15 % .  Check , please . 

Damn it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better .  You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary .  But I make it .  No , you don't have to spend every penny you make , you could save some every month , like a lot of other people do save .  I work hard so I deserve to enjoy , but that costs money .  You should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ?  The problem is that I have no idea . I didn't pay attention .  Let's bygones be bygones , start saving right now . 

What do you reading , Linda ?  I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .  What's it about ?  It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha  Is it difficult to understand ?  Not really , i would consider it easy .  Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence .  I really like short stories .  Have you read anything else besides literature ?  Certainly I have something else besides literature . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time .  I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind . 

You must like to dance , right .  I'd love to dance . Do you often come here to dance ?  Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful .  You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner .  Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ?  okay , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it .  Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all . 

They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears .  I'm very touched , and I can't help bursting into tears at the wedding .  Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's .  Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride .  You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ?  Judy , Why are you so interested in her ?  Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman  He's terribly handsome .  I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive .  Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you .  Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are happy . 

Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ?  I'd love to help you . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's  They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .

It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends . 

Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in .  No , I don't want to go in .  Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it .  Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ?  But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different .  Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world .  I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ?  Yes . That is something I will enjoy .  Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ?  We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like .  I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids .  Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here .  Alright , let's go . 

But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms .  No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide .  Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House .  I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport .  So I can't take my gun then .  Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun .  Yes , it's true I don't have a gun .  You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested !  What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ?  No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much .  I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ?  I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour .  Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast .  First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning .  That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ?  No , I'm fine . 

Ladies and gentlemen , our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport .  Excuse me , Miss. What did the announcement say ?

Don't you remember this important day to us ?  Sorry .  It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .  Our 10th wedding anniversary ?  Of course . You completely forgot it .  Darling . I think you have made a mistake .  I have made a mistake ?  Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .  July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .  Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .  Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?  Since you have booked . Then let's celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .

I will put all the towels under the bathroom door .  I'll have our housekeeper come right away .  I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .  When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .  Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 

I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .  Oh , is there a lot of noise in the next room ? Which room is it ?  It's . I think , neighbours on the right .  You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?  I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .  All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .  If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?

Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .  I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .  What seems to be the trouble now ?  I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as I usually do get .  Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .  Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .  And what about dinner ?  Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .  That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?  I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 

Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college .  Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her .  But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning .  Honey , cheer up .  I feel confused about the grammars .  I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best .  And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated .  Be confident , and never give up .  I know and I won't give up , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad .  Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart .  Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . 

I give up ! I simply can't learn French !  Why do you say that ? I think you're making a whole lot of progress .  No , I'm not making a whole lot of progress . I try and try and I still can'`t speak it very well .  Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?  Good idea . That might help . 

What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ?  Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it .  I think they will get up in arms about it . 

Wow , the view from the peak is so grand !  Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red .  Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?  Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child .  But my father did not take me . He didn't have much time .  Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent .  Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ?  Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time .  It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ?  Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty .  Can I see the rainbow ?  That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . 

John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding .  Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why .  Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen .  Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it .  Would you like to clear the table then ?  Really ? Do I have to clear the table ?  Not , if you don ’ t want to clear the table .  Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ?  Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ?  No , why should I come ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?  Sorry , I thought you knew .  But you should have told me you were in love with her .  Didn't I tell you ?  You know you didn't tell me.  Well , I'm telling you now .  Yes , but you might have told me before .  I didn't think you'd be interested .  You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .  Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 

Would you like a cup of coffee ?  Yes . That would be good .  Oh , no .  What's the matter ?  This machine is out of order .  You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ?  I sure did lose my money .  You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order . 

Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald .  Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he over 80 ?  He ’ s nearly 90 .  Good gracious ! Are you sure ?  I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 .  Is she really 84 ?  Yes , she is 84 . And guess what , he is her sixth husband .  Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she quite a woman ? 

Listen to this . Mary got married .  Is she really married ? I can ’ t believe it !  Yes . Yesterday .  Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !  She married Jerrod .  You ’ re kidding .  She ’ s going to live in Paris .  Really ? I ’ m surprised . 

Are you Elvin ?  Elvin Dixon . Who are you ?  I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you've designed .  Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual .  It is mutual ?  You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet .  I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . 

Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ?  You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers .  Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself .  You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself .  Did you hear the names he was calling me ?  I did hear the names . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 

I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ?  I think you'd better apologize .  Oh , but I can't apologize . It wasn't my fault .  Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 

what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?  I'm sorry . I forgot all about it .  How could you forget ? I reminded you just this morning .  It's leapt my mind . I really feel terrible about it .  I have been looking forward to this performance all month .  I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 

My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race .  Excuse me.What did you say ?  A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games  That's incredible . I can't believe it .  You have to believe it . It's sure .  How amazing ! 

You didn't ring me last night.You said you would be ringing me last night .  I'm sorry to have made you disappointed .  That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch .  Did I behave rudely ? Sorry , I didn't mean to behave rudely . I do apologize .  And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ?  Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 

Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .  If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop .  I did take them back to the shop . But they said they won ’ t change them .  That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . 

I really need a new pair of trousers .  Do you need a new pair of trousers ?  Yes , I do need a new pair of trousers . This one is very old now .  They look all right to me .  They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible .  All right . All right . 

David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?  I ’ m not in the mood .  Why are you feeling depressed ?  I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down .  I didn ’ t think she will do such a thing .  But she has done such a thing and made me disappointed .  Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything .  But she means a lot to me .  Then forgive her mistake .  Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . 

Listen to this . Mary got married .  Is she really married ? I can ’ t believe it !  Yes . Yesterday .  Good gracious . That ’ s incredible !  She married Jerrod .  You ’ re kidding .  She ’ s going to live in Paris .  She will live in Paris ? I ’ m surprised . 

My goodness ! You ’ re kidding !  No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job .  That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you get a good pay here ?  It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities .  Come on ! Don ’ t be silly !  Your present job is something better . Why do you change ?  Well . How do you know ? 

What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .  I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble .  No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ?  I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin .  Is it a two-pin socket ?  Yes , it is a two-pin socket .  Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 

Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?  You know that is tempting but it is really not good for our fitness .  What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .  Do you really think so ? I don't really think so . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?  I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .  I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .  That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .  Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .  Good.Let ' s go now .  All right . 

Hi , Becky , what's up ?  Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .  What's the problem ?  She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around .  For example ?  Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .  No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .  It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .  You said she used to do the same thing ? How did you stop her ?  We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .  That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . 

Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking .  I ’ m sure you do miss your mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?  I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .  I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight .  It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .  You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 

So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?  Stolen ? No , why ?  My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .  Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless .  I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good .  If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened .  He did have an alarm system . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too .  Didn't anyone stop them ?  You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .  Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all .  That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 

Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?  I don ’ t want to sit down and relax .  Well , come and talk to me then .  No, thank you .  May I turn on the radio then ?  Turn on the radio ? What for ?  So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .  Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you cook dinner ?  Ok , I will cook dinner . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .  To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . 

Er ... Alison ?  Ohm , hello , Marcia .  I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win .  Well ... thanks , Marcia. It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ...  It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really !  Do you really think so ? I mean , was I great ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . 

Would you like a cup of coffee ?  Yes, I would like a cup of coffee .  Oh , no .  What's the matter ?  This machine is out of order .  You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ?  I sure did lose my money .  You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . 

Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ?  120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ?  I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid .  Just don't come looking to me for help .  Don't worry . I won't come looking to you for help .  I'm signing off .  Have fun getting ripped off ! 

You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !  Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .  They were supposed to get me an assistant , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .  They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 

How's your new apartment ?  I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't in a quiet neighborhood .  What's wrong ?  One of my neighbors has a dog .  Does it make a lot of noise ?  It barks all night long . 

Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ?  You don ’ t love me , Roy .  Why do you say such words ? I love you very much .  No , you used to love me very much . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting .  Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s .  I envy her and also I hate her at the same time .  Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply .  Oh , shut up , Roy .  But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ...  Oh , SHUT UP ! 

I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ?  What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago .  I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny .  What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?  I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late .  Then when did you go to sleep ?  About 2 o ’ clock in the morning .  When ?  About 2 o ’ clock .  Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ?  You did tell me , but I can ’ t help it .  This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ?  Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired .  So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up .  Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . 

Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore .  But it was her that makes us so embarrassed .  I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , is there a point ?  I don't care . 

Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it .  You do get sick on it ? OK , fine with me .  Thank you so much .  But I also want ya to do me a favor .  What ?  You gotta have some better deodorant .  I ’ m sorry ? ! 

Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ?  You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit .  How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ?  He doesn ’ t give me a hand around the house ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon .  Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here .  You think he might stay even longer ? !  Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can tolerate , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated !  That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 

If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up .  Well , yes , I ’ d like to look you up , if it ’ s not too much trouble .  No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .  That ’ d be fine . 

I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me .  Oh , that ’ s alright .  I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow .  No . Please don ’ t buy me a new one tomorrow . I couldn ’ t let you do that . 

I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .  I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .  Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself .  Have you found anything yet ?  You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?  You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .  I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem .  But the parking might be a problem .  You bet ! 

Would you mind doing something for me ?  I would do something for you if I could .  Would you please explain the meaning of the word ?  Yes , With pleasure . 

Adam . I ’ m sorry .  Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late .  Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another .  why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it close at six ?  Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters .  Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ?  Well , no . I thought I will finish in five minutes  and I didn ’ t want to be difficult for just few minutes. If I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry .  Well . You ’ re here . 

This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ?  A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive .  Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast .  Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly .  Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ?  Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks .  Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car .  Cut it out , would you cut it out ? 

You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ?  No , I ’ m not sure if I ’ m going to make mine yet .  Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ?  No , thanks . I am okay .  You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ...  Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus .  Do you have any idea how much that would cost ?  I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done .  You should study in the library the way I do study in the library . Think of the money you ’ d save .  I ’ Ve got to think it over some more .  I hope you will have second thoughts . 

God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t know ...  ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with .  Excuse me ?  Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind .  You were spying on me , weren ’ t you spying on me ? You probably rented those children .  Why would I spy on you ?  Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner .  The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner .  What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ?  Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . 

Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning .  Again ?  That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .  Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .  Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I definitely will buy a new one .  Maybe by then it will be too late .  What do you mean too late ?  By that time , you will be fired . 

Stop running around in front of the TV , will you stop running around in front of the TV ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ?  I've tried to watch , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program .  Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that .  Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all .  All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram .  Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want .  That's exactly what I want , thank you . 

I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ?  Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course .  I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it difficult at first ?  Surely it was difficult at first , especially when you only knew few people and little English .  You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ?  Right . I only knew a few English sentences .  That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?  First , I worked as a servant .  Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience .  I'd like to tell you , but I must run to a meeting . 

Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ?  Sure , I'd love to accompany you to the party tonight . 

Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?  Sorry , I thought you knew .  But you should tell me you were in love with her .  I thought I did tell you .  You know you didn't tell me .  Well , I am telling you now .  Yes , but you might have told me before .  I didn't think you would be interested .  You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?  Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .  Oh , you men ! You are all the same . 

Have you followed the value of dollar lately ?  How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it .  It's really frustrating , isn't it really frustrating ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .  Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .  What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in .  What about the Yen ?  Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 

I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices .  These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are charging , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit .  Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ?  We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition .  You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . 

are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you !  I know they are draining the life out of me , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week .  Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ...  No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time .  What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .  They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars .  That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?  I would quit , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for .  it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 

Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue .  I don't think I will get another chance at the statue . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ?  And let them ruin my life ? Forget it !  But you've been looking for that stamp for years .  It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills .  Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck .  Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . 

I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me .  It can't be that bad .  But it is that bad ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .  At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day .  That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ?  I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office .  I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit .  Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . 

Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ?  Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all .  So you didn ’ t go to the bank . Is that right ?  Yes . I ’ m sorry .  Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .  Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this .  You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .  But you know if he brought it or not , right ?  Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . 

She is really pretty , isn't she pretty ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth !  Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within .  Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air .  She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ?  Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things .  They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?  Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it .  That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you learned a lot ? 

Did you punch in ?  Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !  Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .  Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?  Sure we do have a meeting this afternoon , when those never ending meetings . 

I feel pity for the old man .  I feel the same way .  It must be dreadful to grow old .  It sure is dreadful to grow old . He has no one to turn to. It is very miserable indeed . 

I was scared stiff of giving my first performance .  Were you scared stiff ? your performance was excellent .  Thank you for your kindly words . 

How much did you bid ?  Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun !  We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! !  But they won't they take all my money ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers .  What if he had his friends fake the reviews ?  You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . 

Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive .  Yeah , it is too expensive ! Why is it so expensive ?  It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design .  I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money .  Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . 

what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .  I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .  don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .  really ? I thought you hated shopping ?  I do hate shopping , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift !  sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on .  how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .  that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?  here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today .  I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?  let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .  this is perfect ! What do you think ?  I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !  I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! 

Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ?  Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original .  Thanks .  I can tell you worked hard on it .  I really did work hard on it ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago .  Well , it was definitely worth all the time .  Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . 

I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ?  Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 dollars  That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500  But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 .  The advertised rate is based on double occupancy .  When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that .  Are you quite sure ?  Yes, I am quite sure . Have a look .  I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page .  Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate .  Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim .  Thank you . 

Your search on this project has been excellent .  Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team .  The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .  Well , I hope the client feels the same way !  I am sure they will feel the same way . 

So , Emily , how was your day ?  I don't think you really want to hear about it .  It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it .  To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck !  Why ? What happened ?  Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !  That's not very fair . What did you do ?  There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure .  Does he treat everyone in your department like this ?  He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake !  Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?  I really don't have any idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair !  Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?  Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion .  That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .  I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .  That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 

I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !  Why ? What are they like ?  They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !  Have you ever talked to them about it ?  I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !  What did they say ?  They both just talk about how great they are all the time .  They sound like the neighbours from hell !  They are neighbours from hell ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .  I thought you didn't talk to them much .  I don't talk to them , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .  What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?  Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .  Maybe you should think about moving .  I can't afford to move right now .  Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .  I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .  Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? 

Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard .  I think it does taste like cardboard . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . 

Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ?  I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday .  How come ?  It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't laugh at her .  I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ?  Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 

Hurry up . Time is running out .  I see . I have to run as fast as I can run . 

what a nice uniform !  thanks ; do you like it ?  not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ?  yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional .  they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ?  I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day .  so are you enjoying your new job ?  it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great .  how do you like working in sales ?  I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster .  that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department .  yeah , I have met Jane . She's a genius saleswoman !  I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos !  how do you know her ?  she's my cousin .  why didn't you tell me about that before ?  I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting .  well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime .  that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . 

you're rather energetic today . What's going on ?  nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees .  free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it one of the perks at this place ?  it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ?  not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today .  why is that ?  my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend !  your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he a real salve-driver ?  you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work !  that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office .  really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy .  maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all !  no , he is horrible . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T .  try not to let it bother you too much .  thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again !  ok , I'll see you in a bit .  alright . See you later ! 

is everything alright ?  yes , everything is fine .  what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !  didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?  I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ?  we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem .  then what ? Your plane was three hours late !  we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight .  turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it pretty normal ?  yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early .  so where did you land ?  we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again .  that sounds like a nightmare !  it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive .  have you had anything to eat ?  I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ?  I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 

wow , it that your sports car ?  yes , do you like it ?  I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ?  it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again .  what's wrong with it ?  well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive .  when's the last time you had it serviced ?  it must have been a few years ago now .  I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .  they do need regular servicing on a yearly basis . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know !  what else is wrong with it ?  the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !  anything else ?  the brakes don't really work that well anymore either .  why don't you get it all fixed ?  it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !  well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 

did you get my email ?  I certainly did get your email . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?  sure .  how did the business trip go ?  well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .  I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat !  I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !  our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .  I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me .  I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today .  thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted !  no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?  no , should I have brought any gifts back for my department ? 

Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .  I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .  I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?  Yes , we do have your reservation , unfortunately we ran out of cars .  But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .  I know why we have reservations .  I don ’ t think you do know . If you did know , I ’ d have a car. See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .  But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like .  Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .  Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?  Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . 

hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?  oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .  what ' the matter ?  the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .  I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .  yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .  that's true .  anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?  it was good . I brought lunch from home today .  you did bring lunch from home today ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do get in America .  well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .  i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .  yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you believe fast food is your lifestyle ?  you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .  well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .  seriously ?  yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 

it's getting cold .  yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look .  Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern .  yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ?  it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .  how about this blue sweater ?  that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?  yes it is a name brand , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ?  that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings .  I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is .  perfect !  you have good fashion sense , Karen .  thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there .  yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . 

Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful .  Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?  Yes , I do like the rockery with the smaller flowers . Those are violets , aren ’ t they violets ?  Yes , they are violets . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge .  The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ?  Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed .  When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .  Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect .  Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 

I'm not satisfied with it .  Why not ? What's wrong with it ?  Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn't work , either .  Would you like another one ?  No . Can I have my money back ?  Hmm ... have you got a receipt ?  A receipt ?  You can't have your money back without receipt .  Oh , I'm not certain if I do have a receipt , but I think I've lost it . 

Car trouble center . How may I help you ?  My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car !  Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems .  Fine .  OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ?  Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor .  Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?  Yeah , I usually do hear the starter motor crank when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ?  No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start .  So what do you think it is ?  I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?  Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !  What is it ? What happened ?  I think someone is stalking me .  Really ? Who ?  I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .  What did you do ?  I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .  Did he leave when you left ?  Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .  What did you do ?  He followed me all the way home !  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .  Yes , he was following me . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !  Of course you can call the police if you want to call the police . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .  I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .  Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 

What do you think of this one ?  Eh , so so .  And this one ? Too flashy ?  Nah , not too flashy .  Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?  I guess .  Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .  And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !  Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !  Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !  Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !  You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you just insult the Sals-bury Seals ? Why don ’ t you just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?  I might just go and return all of those stupid clothes ! Enjoy your stupid game !  And Merry Christmas !  Merry Christmas ! 

What are you doing ?  Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty .  Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful !  Yes , I am beautiful , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery. I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ?  I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural .  Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well .  I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing .  I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive .  You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts !  Really ?  Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 

Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do take !  I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help .  What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ?  I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well .  Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .  Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 

Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .  Well you should have picked the film , in the end you always complain about everything .  Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .  I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative .  I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .  You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore  Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .  Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories .  Love stories ? More like one-night-stands .  Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints .  My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?  You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 

Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you .  I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend .  don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can spend . Besides we can go to the beach anytime .  thanks for understanding .  well that's what being friends is about .  hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .  Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves .  I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about .  maybe ... I'll think about it . 

we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ?  I'm not sure if I am coming . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ?  oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's .  Jack ?  yes , the one with the R & D team . Is that a problem ?  I will never go out with him anymore .  why did you say so ?  last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all !  oh , really ?  he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly .  are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?  it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him .  what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ?  I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much .  maybe he should really do something about eating etiquette .  oh , he really should do something about eating etiquette . 

He followed me all the way home !  That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you .  Yes , he most likely was following me . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ?  Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call .  Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !  Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .  I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is .  Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry .  Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 

You are not being a good sport about this .  That's because you cheated .  I never cheat .  Yes , you do cheat .

The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move !  What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help !  Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady !  I ’ m going as fast as I can go !  Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes .  You ’ re such a geek !

Can I help you , sir ?  Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car .  I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump .  Self-service ?  Yes . You must fill up the car yourself .  Are you serious ?  Yes . Are you traveling here ?  Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car .  In America , most gas stations are like this .  Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how to do it .  Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign .  What sign ?  Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs .  I see . 

I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday .  If you would like me to help you with that , I could help you with that .  Wouldn't that take you away from your project ?  I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me .  Is there a good time for you to help me ?  If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday .  How about meeting in my office ?  That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have .  Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot .  Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise !
