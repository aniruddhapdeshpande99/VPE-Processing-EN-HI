Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place .\n",

      "So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? Nine total . Seven children and my parents . Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .\n",

I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? I'd love to do that .
